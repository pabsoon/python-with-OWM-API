# python-with-OWM-API
The first approach to creating a Python application using GUI and API.

Project objective to test my skills in writing applications (in this case in Python).

Main assumptions of this project:
* Application has a simple GUI displaying basic weather data (I used PyQt5 library)
* Weather data is downloaded using the free version of the API - [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
* Data like API key are stored in the file (used ConfigParser) and data is not uploaded to repo.
